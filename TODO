Configuration:
	- Turn off update checks
		This really has to be implemented in Alfred-Workflow if `workflow:update` is still to work.

New features:
	- Allow to/cc/bcc fields
		Adding 'to', 'cc' or 'bcc' as a recipient would add following recipients to that field
		- Add indicator to result titles that cc/bcc mode is active
			i.e. show "cc Lance Uppercut" instead of "Lance Uppercut"
		- Warn if client doesn't like cc/bcc in mailto: URIs
			- Test if there *are* any clients that don't like cc/bcc in mailto: URIs
